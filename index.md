Hello and welcome to my Bar Mitzvah website.

I'm so excited for you to be a part of my coming of age. Camp Young Judea has been a very happy and fun place for me. Camp has been a large part of my life for six amazing summers. I hope that it will seem just as magical and beautiful to you when you visit. I started my Bar Mitzvah practice over a year ago and I have been working hard to make it just right for this occasion. All of that hard work for one special weekend of my life in one special place in my life. I hope to see you at CYJ on October 9 2015.
