Welcome family and friends to Arik's CYJ Bar Mitzvah website!

You are invited to spend the weekend with us at CYJ from Friday, October 9 to Sunday, October 11.
If you'd like to contribute towards your lodging, you are welcome to donate via paypal.

If multi-family cabins and lodges aren't quite your thing, we hope you will check out our
recommendations to nearby B&B's.
If you choose a B&B, reserve your space as soon as possible.

Please don't hesitate to contact us by email or phone with any questions or requests.

Remember to come back to the site as information may change as we get closer to Arik's event date,
and updates will be communicated primarily through this web site.

We look forward to spending a weekend together celebrating Arik becoming a Bar Mitzvah!
