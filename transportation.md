If your child will be needing transportation to and from the camp, please send us an email and we will happily coordinate carpools from Austin, Dallas, San Antonio, and Houston.  We already have some volunteer families lined up, but if your family is able to provide an extra seat or 2, please let us know if we can call on you!
