Camp Young Judea has lodging facilities in the form of cabins and lodge rooms.
Your specific accommodation will be furnished upon arrival.

If multi-family cabins and lodges aren't quite your thing, we hope you will check out our
recommendations to nearby B&B's.  If you choose a B&B, reserve your space as soon as possible.

If you'd like to contribute towards your lodging at CYJ, you are welcome to do so via paypal.
