Camp Young Judaea (CYJ) has lodging facilities in the form of cabins and lodge rooms.
Your specific accommodation will be furnished upon arrival.

Arik's friends will be staying together in (girl and boy-designated) cabins with designated counselors.


If multi-family cabins and lodges aren't quite your thing, here are links to nearby accommodations:

</ul>

Also, hotels in Dripping Springs, SouthWest Austin or San Marcos are relatively nearby.  If you choose a B&B, reserve your space as soon as possible.

If you'd like to contribute towards your lodging at CYJ, you are welcome to do so via paypal.

## Dining

All dining food and snacks in the dining hall are prepared in the CYJ kosher-certified kitchen.
ALL kosher laws within the Dining Hall (Chadar Ochel) are strictly enforced.
However, friends and family are welcome to bring "kosher style" desserts and noshes to share
in the Lodge hospitality room.  Anyone that has Grandma G's/Yetta's cookbook, please oblige!
