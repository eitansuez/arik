First and foremost we want all of our guests to be COMFORTABLE!
So, NO jackets or ties. Comfortable shoes are a MUST in order to enjoy the weekend to the fullest.
There is uneven terrain throughout the camp and we want everyone to be safe and sure-footed :-)

## Friday night dinner

Casual for indoor barbecue and evening campfire songs.

<div class="small">(
  All dining food and snacks in the dining hall are prepared in the CYJ kosher-certified kitchen.
  ALL kosher laws within the Dining Hall (Chadar Ochel) are strictly enforced.
  However, friends and family are welcome to bring "kosher style" desserts and noshes to share
  in the Lodge hospitality room.  Anyone that has Grandma G's/Yetta's cookbook, please oblige!

## Saturday morning outdoor service

Men can wear short sleeved collared shirts, casual slacks. Women should dress comfortably but modestly
(you will be sitting on elevated amphitheater steps).
It is a custom at camp for the children to wear any kind of white shirt.
This can also apply to any adult as well :-)


## Saturday dinner and party

Festive COMFORTABLE attire. The kids, of course, are welcome to bring their best dresses
and duds to dance the evening away!

Linens, towels, and pillows will be provided. BUT, if you have that "special pillow" that will
make your stay more enjoyable, please bring it!

Please bring all necessary toiletries.
