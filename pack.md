First and foremost we want all of our guests to be COMFORTABLE!
So, NO jackets or ties. Comfortable shoes are a MUST in order to enjoy the weekend to the fullest.
There is uneven terrain throughout the camp and we want everyone to be safe and sure-footed :-)

## Friday night

Casual for outdoor services and evening activities.

## Saturday morning

For services, men can wear short sleeved collared shirts, casual slacks. Women should dress comfortably but modestly (you will be sitting on elevated amphitheater steps).

It is a custom at camp for the children to wear any kind of white shirt.
This can also apply to any adult as well :-)

There will be pool time later on in the day, so don't forget bathing suits.

Also, bring athletic clothes (both children and grown-ups) as there will be plenty of opportunity to use the camp facilities:  basketball, tennis, ball fields.  Feel free to bring rackets, balls, or even a bike.


## Saturday night party

Festive COMFORTABLE attire. <b>We request that Arik's friends bring Hawaiian-themed attire.</b>

Linens, towels, and pillows will be provided. BUT, if you have that "special pillow" that will
make your stay more enjoyable, please bring it!

Please bring all necessary toiletries.
