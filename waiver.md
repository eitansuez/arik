Here is a [liability waiver](/release_form.pdf) (pdf) that CYJ requires of the kids who attend functions.
If you have multiple kids who will be at camp, feel free to just list them all on one form.

Please complete and sign the form and scan it back to Bar Twito [bar@cyjtexas.org](mailto:bar@cyjtexas.org)).
If you prefer fax, here's CYJ's fax number:  713.728.5061

Thanks for your cooperation and assistance.
