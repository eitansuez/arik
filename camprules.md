We want everyone to have a safe and fun weekend. For everyoneâ€™s safety, we would appreciate your cooperation with the following:

* Please turn off all cell phones during the services.
* Parents must supervise their young children and know where they are at all times. Counselors are responsible only for the teens sleeping at camp. Please do not ask any camp staff to supervise your children.
* No children are allowed near the lake without adult supervision.
* Swimming in the aquatic center or any water features is not allowed other than during authorized times with life guards present.
* All cars must park only in designated areas. Do not drive any car into the cabin areas at any time.
* For parents with young children, please instruct your children not to leave the dining room (Chadar Ochel) without you.
* The CYJ Lodge doors cannot be locked when you are not in your room. We suggest that you do not bring any valuables, as we cannot be responsible for your property. If you feel the need to bring valuables, you may lock them in your vehicle. Bring valuables at your own risk.
* Smoking is prohibited in all areas except the designated smoking area - the patio behind the CYJ Lodge.
* Respect camp property and deposit trash in bins. Do not litter.
* Many events will be held outdoors so be prepared and careful keeping in mind that there could be injuries or discomfort from the elements including animals, plants and insects.
* The ground is uneven throughout camp, so please be careful when walking.
 

HAVE A GREAT TIME!!!

## The Waiver

If you are coming to camp, we need you to sign the Camp Young Judaea waiver.  Once you RSVP, we will send it to you for signature.  Once signed, please send to [Bar Twito](mailto:bar@cyjtexas.org) at CYJ.
